#### Basic usage

A modal is typically used for confirmations, alerts, or contextual actions. This example shows a confirmation dialog with a title, description, and footer action button.

<ModalBase />

```tsx
<Modal
  isOpen={modalOpen}
  onClickClose={() => setModalOpen(false)}
  title="Confirmation"
  description="Are you sure you want to proceed?"
  footer={<Button onClick={() => setModalOpen(false)}>Yes</Button>}
/>
```

#### Size variants

The `size` prop controls the width of the modal content. Use predefined sizes (`xs`, `s`, `m`, `l`) for consistency across the design system.

<ModalSizing />

```tsx
  <Modal isOpen title="Mini Modal" size="xs" />
  <Modal isOpen title="Small Modal" size="s" />
  <Modal isOpen title="Default Modal" size="m" />
  <Modal isOpen title="Large Modal" size="l" />
```

#### Full‑screen modal

Fullscreen mode is useful for immersive flows, mobile devices, or complex forms. It expands to cover the entire viewport, while still providing standard close actions.

<ModalFullScreen />

```tsx
<Modal
  onEsc={() => setModalOpen(false)}
  isCloseButton
  isOpen={modalOpen}
  isFullScreen
  title="Full Screen Modal"
  onClickClose={() => setModalOpen(false)}>
  <p>Content that spans the entire viewport height and width.</p>
</Modal>
```

#### Best practices

  - Always include a title — provides context and improves accessibility.
  - Use description sparingly — only when additional clarity is required.
  - Place actions in the footer — primary/secondary buttons like Save, Cancel, Confirm.
  - Enable close button and Esc support — users expect consistent exit patterns.
  - Use fullscreen wisely — for mobile or immersive tasks, not for simple prompts.
  - Stick to design-system sizes — ensures consistent layout across the app.
  - Hide all exit options — avoid trapping the user.
  - Overuse fullscreen modals — can feel overwhelming for small tasks.
  - Apply excessive custom CSS — prefer theme tokens and provided props.
  - Overlap too many modals — stacking creates confusion; avoid unless necessary.
