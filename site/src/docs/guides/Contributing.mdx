#### General principles

  - *Communication*: Check if there is already an open [issue](https://github.com/quen-ui/quen-ui/issues) in our repository. If not, you can create a new one. Also check the [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/quen-ui/discussions) threads.
  - *Transparency*: All discussions regarding development and contributions should be transparent, so that all participants can monitor progress and provide feedback.
  - *Documentation*: Documentation is extremely important. Document all changes made and add clear comments in the code.
  - *Quality*: We prioritize the quality of the code and its implementation. Be sure to follow our coding standards and conduct comprehensive testing.

#### Methods of making a contribution

  - *Improve the documentation*: Fix incomplete or missing documentation, bad wording, examples, or explanations.
  - *Give us feedback*: We are constantly working to improve QuenUI. Please tell us how you use QuenUI, what features are missing, and what is implemented well in the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/quen-ui/discussions).
  - *Share*: Share links to QuenUI documentation with anyone who might be interested!
  - *Contribute to the codebase*: Suggest new features via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/quen-ui/quen-ui/issues) or find an existing issue that interests you and work on it!
  - *Provide us with code reviews*: Help us identify problems in the source code or make QuenUI more performant.

#### Facilitating the workflow

  - Decide what you want to contribute.
  - If you want to implement a new feature, discuss it on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/quen-ui/discussions) before you start coding.
  - Once you have clarified the details of the issue, you can start working on the code.
  - Run `npm test` tests and submit a PR once they pass.
  - Get your code reviewed and fix any issues that are noticed by a maintainer.
  - If you can't complete the task or change your mind, no problem! Just let us know in the GitHub issue you created in step one.

#### Getting started

##### General rules

  - All code is written in **TypeScript**.
  - Styles are formatted using styled-components and a theme from the `packages/theme` package.
  - Follow a single code style (lint + prettier).
  - All changes must be accompanied by tests and updated documentation.

##### How to start?

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/quen-ui/quen-ui), then clone or download your fork.
2. Run `nvm use` to switch to the Node version specified in your .nvmrc file ([install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) ).
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Run:
  - `npm run storybook` - Run storybook
  - `npm run site` - Run site with documentation
  - `npm run docgen` - Generate props description.
5. Make changes to the desired package in `packages/*` or on the `site`.

##### Repository structure

  - `packages/components` — UI components
  - `packages/theme` — theme and tokens
  - `packages/hooks` — custom hooks
  - `packages/helpers` — utilities
  - `site` - documentation site

Each package has its own `package.json` and is built separately.

##### Branches and commits

  - Main branch: main.
  - New work is done in feature branches:
    `feature/<short-name>` - for new features
    `fix/<short-name>` - for bugfixes
    `chore/<short-name>` - for auxiliary tasks
  - We write commits in the format [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):
    ```markdown
        feat(button): added outline option
        fix(input): fixed validation bug
        chore: updated dependencies
    ```

##### Testing

  - Tests are mandatory for all new features and components.
  - To run: `npm run test`.
  - Make sure the tests pass before pushing.

##### Linting and formatting

Checking the code: `npm run lint`.

##### Documentation

  - All public changes should be reflected in Storybook / MDX docs.
  - If the component API changes, update the usage examples.


##### Code Review

  - All changes go through a Pull Request.
  - PR must contain:
    - a brief description of the task,
    - a list of changes,
    - screenshots/examples (if it's UI).
  - Before creating a PR, make sure that:
    ✅ all tests pass,
    ✅ no linting errors,
    ✅ docs/changelog updated (if needed).
