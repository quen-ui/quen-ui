QuenUI provides a collection of beautifully crafted, accessible, and highly customizable React components to help you build stunning interfaces faster. Whether you're prototyping a new idea or building a production-ready application, QuenUI has everything you need to get started in minutes.

#### Installation
Get QuenUI up and running in your project with just one command:

```bash
  npm install @quen-ui/components @quen-ui/theme
```

#### Basic Setup
Wrap your application with the QuenUIProvider to enable theming and global styles:

```tsx
import { QuenUIProvider } from "@quen-ui/theme";

function App() {
  return (
    <QuenUIProvider theme="light">
      <YourApp />
    </QuenUIProvider>
  );
}
```

#### Using Your First Component
Import and use QuenUI components just like any other React component:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@quen-ui/components";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => alert('Hello, QuenUI!')}>
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

#### Customization & Theming
QuenUI is designed for flexibility. Override default styles or create your own theme effortlessly:

```tsx
<QuenUIProvider
  theme={{
    colors: {
      primary: '#4F46E5',
      secondary: '#10B981',
    },
    fonts: {
      body: 'Inter, sans-serif',
    },
