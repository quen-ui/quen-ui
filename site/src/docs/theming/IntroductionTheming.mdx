#### What is Theming?

Theming is a systematic approach to styling your application that ensures visual consistency across all components while maintaining flexibility for customization. In QuenUI, theming allows you to:

- Define a unified design language (colors, typography, spacing)
- Switch between visual styles (e.g., light/dark mode)
- Customize components without modifying individual instances
