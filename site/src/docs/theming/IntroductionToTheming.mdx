#### What is theming?

Theming is a systematic approach to styling your application that ensures visual consistency across all components while maintaining flexibility for customization. In QuenUI, theming allows you to:

- Define a unified design language (colors, typography, spacing)
- Switch between visual styles (e.g., light/dark mode)
- Customize components without modifying individual instances


#### Why use theming?

- Consistency: All components share the same design tokens
- Maintainability: Change styles globally in one place
- Accessibility: Built-in contrast ratios and color systems
- Brand Alignment: Match your company's visual identity

#### Theme types

- Default Themes: Pre-built light/dark themes
- Custom Themes: Extend or create from scratch
